# Introduction to Quantitative Analysis in R

This repository contains all materials used for the *Introduction to Quantitative Analysis in R* class, delivered as part of the [SEDarc DTP](https://www.sedarc.ac.uk/) on 29 October 2025.

This session will offer an accessible introduction to quantitative data analysis in R, combining key theoretical ideas with practical, hands-on examples. You will learn the basics of R â€” how to create variables, work with different data types, organise and manipulate data frames, make simple visualisations, and import or save datasets. We will also discuss how to manage your R projects effectively, including using packages and setting up your working directory. From there, we will explore key descriptive statistics for both continuous and categorical variables before moving on to inferential methods such as chi-square tests, t-tests, correlation analysis, and linear regression. Throughout the session, we will focus on understanding how these models work, why they work this way, and what this means for interpretation, including topics such as model assumptions, transformations, and contrast coding. There will be opportunities for questions throughout, followed by a dedicated Q&A session at the end. By the end of the session, you will have developed practical skills in performing and interpreting simple statistical analyses in R, with an emphasis on reproducibility, clear workflows, and confidence in applying what you've learned to your own data.

The class begins with an introduction to what quantitative analysis is and why R is an excellent tool for it. We then briefly cover how to install R and RStudio, supported by the PowerPoint slides available in this folder. Next, we move to a live demo, where I demonstrate the layout of RStudio and introduce some basic functions (see the script with the .R extension for this part).

Most of the class content is based on the materials in the .html file (and its source .Rmd file). If you'd like to follow along or review the main topics covered in the session, start there. The data used in this course are located in the 'data' folder.

Other files in the repository (such as .Rds and titanic_data_edited.csv) are generated automatically when you run the .Rmd file on your own machine.
